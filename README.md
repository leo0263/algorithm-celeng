My Algorithm Challenges Code

## what?

These are the algorithm challenges code that I've wrote. Note: Only the ever-changing-harddrive-pre-github-era-survivor codes are available.

## why?

So they are not lost in the void. The code I mean.

## how?

I'm uploading my surviving code while cleaning and formatting them in a cleaner, readable, ready-to-run format.

## setup

Here's the ultimate competitive programming challenges setup I've discovered:

- PC : Pre loved, battle hardened Thinkpad x230T
- OS : [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- VCS : Github
- IDE : [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- CP oriented plugin : [IO Run](https://github.com/openhoangnc/vscode-io-run)

The most important combination was the VS-Code + IO-Run plugin. It really simplify your compile+test process. Especially when your goal was to make a problem + test-cases. As I did a while back in [SRIN](http://www.samsung.com/id/srin/) as the local branch problem-setter. 

## misc

Samsung R&D held a global, periodically "certification" in a Competitive Programming Challenges format. It aims to hone it's developers programming skill. The contest format is much like ACM-ICPC but held monthly and had one problem only. Passing developers are awarded with "certification level" that gradually increases the challenge level.
